## LEGAL BACKSTOP

This license is inspired by the [Polyform Noncommercial License](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0/).

That means:
- You get the freedom to explore and learn.
- I retain the right to keep you from exploiting educational software for cash.

## WANT A COMMERCIAL LICENSE?

Sure. Let’s make a deal. I’m not unreasonable. But you will pay artists, hackers, and whoever wrote that one cursed regex.
