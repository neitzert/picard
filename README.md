### ⚙️ PICARD — Protocol-Introspecting Chunk Adapter for Resilient Data ⚙️

Picard 'makes it so', no matter what the underlying medium is. Doesn’t matter if it’s IRC, SMTP, IPoAC, or vibes-based quantum gossip, Picard figures it out, builds a resilient, encrypted, RWX-ready filesystem on top, and keeps it alive in harsh conditions.

🧠 Core Philosophy

* Treat all protocols as potential storage/messaging substrates.

* Auto-detect capabilities and limitations.

* Adapt transmission, chunking, and retrieval strategy accordingly.

* Support encryption, redundancy, and failover.

* Operate with long-term stability, not short-term performance.

* Allow read/write wherever feasible, fallback to read-only if not.
