### ⚙️ PICARD — Protocol-Introspecting Chunk Adapter for Resilient Data ⚙️

🧠 Core Philosophy
Treat all protocols as potential storage/messaging substrates.

Auto-detect capabilities and limitations.

Adapt transmission, chunking, and retrieval strategy accordingly.

Support encryption, redundancy, and failover.

Operate with long-term stability, not short-term performance.

Allow read/write wherever feasible, fallback to read-only if not.
